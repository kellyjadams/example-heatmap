# example-heatmap

My code for the heatmap I shared in my [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kellyjianadams_revised-heatmap-activity-7219065744246898688-6p6K?). You can find the final code in the `final_heatmap.py` file. The `heatmap.ipynb` file shows the revisions I made based on feedback. 

For more background information check out my blog post: [Blog Post Title]()

**Note:** This has been revised from my original heatmap I made, see my blog post [Heat Map Example](https://www.kellyjadams.com/post/heatmap-example-for-linkedin-post-7-12-24) for that.
